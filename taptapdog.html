Hopefully this project will change that! At the moment, the game dispenses treats when the dog/cat/werewolf hits the blue button on an iDevice's screen.</p><p>You can see it in action below: </p><iframe margin="auto" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/56JiGq6cuHs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe><br/><br/><br/><br/><h2 class="section-heading"> The Game </h2><div class="thing-box"><div class='thing'><img class='square-image' src='tt_menu.png'><div class='thing-title'>Menu</div><div class='thing-text'><p class='small-text'>The home screen.

Xcode, the IDE for designing iOS apps, as well as Swift, the programming language, were not very learner-friendly. A lot went into every small step, from getting a sound to play, to switching into and out of the games, to just getting the program to run on my phone. And getting it onto the iPad was another adventure. </p><p> Despite the high levels of frustruation, I'm glad I undertook this project. The skills to program in Swift are <emph> very </emph> different from programing in Python, Ruby, Javascript, Fortran, and every other language I've studied. Knowing variable types and integers was helpful, by more important was patinece with Google searches, and a willingness to accept that I just won't understand what's going on for the time being, and that's okay. I don't understand even half of what everything means, but I'm making it work for me and that's something. </p>     <p> Despite the high levels of frustruation, I'm glad I undertook this<p> Plus, this is the first useful program I've made. It's rewarding to see Gandalf get excited when I show him the blue screen, and also to see his sad face when he realizes play time is over. </p>    </div></body>
